## <span id="jump-1">Installing Ballance</span>

There are a few ways to install Ballance, each with its own pros and cons.  
All the resources referred in installation steps can be found in our [official network disk](#jump-9). All of them are located in the `Installer` folder.

* **[Beginner Installation](#jump-1-1): The most common installer suitable for almost everyone, especially beginners. We HIGHLY SUGGEST you choose this method.**
* [Vanilla Installation](#jump-1-2): If you just need vanilla Ballance and is experienced with it, choose this.
* <span style="opacity:0.3">[Old Installation](#jump-1-3): The old installer which was used before May 2023. This method is deprecated; don't use it.</span>

### <span id="jump-1-1">Beginner Installation</span>

First, Download `Ballance-13levels-bbugdistro-high.exe`. This is a 7z self extractor. Run it and choose a directory to store the installer files.

???+ danger "Don't move files!"
    After running the installer, the decompressed files CANNOT be moved easily.  
    It is highly recommended to place the decompressed files in a folder where you won't regret it later on.

After decompressing, go to the aforementioned folder which contains the decompressed files, then run `install.bat`. When Windows asks for administrator privileges, just press Yes. The installation may take a while, so be patient.

??? question "Is this batch file harmful? Why it need admin privileges?"
    If you're entirely sure that this User Account Control window was triggered by this installer, then no need to worry; it is harmless for your PC.  
    This batch file needs admin privileges to modify some registry keys which is essential for Ballance installation.  
    This installer is open source, by the way; [here's the source code.](https://github.com/Xenapte/BallanceSetupTools)

Note that if you install Ballance with this method, you don't need to install BML as this comes pre-installed.  
To run Ballance, double-click the desktop shortcut named `Ballance Player`.  

???+ question "Why are there 2 shortcuts on my desktop? Which one is real?"
    After the installation, you may see 2 new shortcuts on your desktop. Both of these can launch Ballance, but they're different.  
    `Ballance` points to `Startup.exe`, which is the launcher for Ballance. Meanwhile, `Ballance Player` points to `bin\Player.exe`, which just opens the game directly. We suggest using the `Ballance Player` shortcut as this is faster than using the `Ballance` shortcut.  

??? info "How do I toggle fullscreen mode"
    By default, Ballance runs in fullscreen. If you want to toggle that, run `switch fullscreen.bat`. It may also need administrator privileges.

??? info "How do I uninstall Ballance?"
    Run `uninstall.bat`.

### <span id="jump-1-2">Vanilla Installation</span>

!!! info "What is Vanilla? Who need it?"
    Vanilla means the base game, without any modifications.  
    This method only suit for some Ballance players with some experience. It is **not** suit for beginner of Ballance especially. Additionally, if you just want a pure vanilla Ballance and don't want BML and etc. This installation method may be also suit for you.

0. Download `Ballance-12levels-vanilla.iso`. This ISO file is no modification installer published by Atari. Load it as a virtual CD and run its installer. This operation will installer a 12 levels Ballance for you.
0. 12 levels Ballance is not the common Ballance we played. We need patch it with official patch and transform it into 13 levels Ballance. Download `Sudu-BallanceLevel13.zip`. A patch manual has placed in zip file. See [Installing Level 13 chapter](#jump-6) for more detail.
0. If you need some extra things, such as BML and etc. See corresponding section to know how to install them.

### <span id="jump-1-3">Old Installation</span>

!!! warning "Deprecated Installer"
    This installation method now is deprecated. See Beginner Installation for the latest install method.  
    This section only is served for preserving old content.

<span style="opacity:0.3">
Download `Ballance-13levels-cndistro-low.exe` and run it to install Ballance. This is the very old installer for the most players. Now this installer is **deprecated**.  
Note that this installer is in Chinese. Install is just a click of Next button away. We are finding better way to distribute and install Ballance.

## <span id="jump-2">Installing Custom Maps</span>

### Normal Method

## <span id="jump-3">Running Ballance on Windows 10 / Windows 11</span>

We **highly recommand** that install [BML (2020 version)](#jump-10) to solve any compatibility issues.

If you really do not want to install it, you also can go to Ballance's root folder and right-click Startup.exe, select `Properties`. Select the `Compatibility` tab, then check the box next to `Run this program in compatibility mode for:`. Follow this order to set the version of Windows: `Windows 7` -> `Windows Vista SP2` -> `Windows XP SP3` -> `Windows XP SP2` -> `Windows 95` until the game can run normally.

## <span id="jump-4">Running Ballance on Linux or macOS</span>

Wine or Valve Proton may help you to run Ballance on Linux or macOS (use `Bin/Player.exe` to start the game).  
You also can install a virtual machine with Windows 7 to play Ballance if Wine or Proton are not working. Do not install Windows XP virtual machine, because BML and various plugins do not support Windows XP.

## <span id="jump-5">Installing Debug Mode</span>

!!! warning "Outdated Content Warning"
    This method is only suitable for the installation of the old version of BML (2015 version), which is no longer supported. Please go to [the chapter of installing BML](#jump-10) for details.

<span style="opacity:0.3">
If you want to use debug mode, you need to install the **old BallanceModLoader** (2015 version) first. See the [section of Installing BML](#jump-10) to learn how to install.
</span>

<span style="opacity:0.3">
Debug mode's download URL can be got from our [official network disk](#jump-9). Open the `Plugin` directory and download `Debug_Mode.nmo`.
</span>

<span style="opacity:0.3">
If you have installed BallanceModLoader successfully, you can install `Debug_Mode.nmo`. Navigate to your Ballance installation directory, put `Debug_Mode.nmo` to `ModLoader/Mod`. Now launch the game. If you see some words displayed at the top of the game, congratulations! You have installed Debug mode successfully.
</span>

## <span id="jump-6">Installing Level 13 / Twilight Zone / SuDu</span>

If you are using the original CD version of Ballance, this tutorial will introduce how to install the official SuDu plugin (Level 13 plugin).

1. Go to our [official network disk](#jump-9) to download the plugin which is located in the `Installer` folder, called `SuDu-BallanceLevel13.zip`.
1. Use a compression software, such as Winzip or 7z to decompress it.

## <span id="jump-7">How to Get Custom Maps</span>

There are various ways to download custom maps.

!!! info "I Can't Read Map's Name in Chinese!"
    You may notice the name of almost custom maps is in Chinese. That's because the Ballance community in China was more florescent than the international community 10 years ago.  
    But don't worry. A friendly Ballance player provides a extraordinary table including following fields.
    
    * Map author, release date, original name and translated name (extremely better than previous machine translation).
    * Map type and difficulty.
    * Map post ID and LucaS video ID (convenient for the players coming from LucaS videos).
    * Related videos for previewing maps.
    * etc...

    **See [pseudoacetyl/BallanceCustomMaps](https://github.com/pseudoacetyl/BallanceCustomMaps/blob/main/CustomMapList.md) for more infomation.** Thank pseudoacetyl!

### Map Pack

Map Pack contains lots of high-quality custom maps. However, the map pack may only be updated every few years. So if you need some latest custom maps, try other methods.

__[**Click Here to Download Ballance Map Pack (Version 7.6)**](http://www.mediafire.com/folder/vyzo7893i0oln/Ballance_Map_Packs)__

### Discord

You can find recent custom maps in `#new`. You also can search `#new` with file limitation to get what you need.  
However, this Discord server was established in 2018, so obviously some custom maps can not be found in our Discord server channels. In this case, try using other methods.

### Network Disk

Our network disk allow you download custom maps individually. It also contain the oldest and the latest custom maps. However, this network disk is hosted by Chinese Ballance Forum, translators needed.

## <span id="jump-8">Recording Ballance Videos</span>

Want to record your ballance runs but don't know how to?

Well, don't worry, there is always a solution. Download OBS Studio here: https://obsproject.com/

It supports MP4, youtube, and more.

Tutorial video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XllRHuCe07A

For 856x480 resolution: Change the Video Bitrate to 1000.
For 1280x720 resolution: Change the Video Bitrate to 1500.

Don't want to send your videos to youtube? You can upload your video to streamable: https://streamable.com/

Videos are located in File / Show Recordings.

How do I know what size of the video will be?

There is an Option called Replay Buffer. If you use 1280x720 with 1500 Bitrate, it will take up more memory.
(e.g: With 856x480, 5 minutes is 36MB. With 1280x720 it is 52MB.)

Is there another way to start recording other than manually touching the "Start Recording" button?

Yes. Go to Files, Settings, and then Hotkeys. I suggest you put it like these:
 - Start Recording: F1
 - Stop Recording: F2

How do I capture the video?

When you open OBS, you will see a small window called "Sources".

Click the `+`, and select Game Capture.
When you have done it, click OK.

You must name the Game Capture, of course.

Then, a window will pop up. If you have created a Game Capture named "Ballance", you can either put it to capture any fullscreen application, but if you want to, click Mode and then put it on "Capture Specific Window. It will give you an option of what window to put. If the window is correct, then start the game and record.

Want the audio to be recorded? Try setting it on one of the speaker options.

## <span id="jump-10">Installing Ballance Mod Loader</span>

Ballance Mod Loader (BML) is a free open-source API to expand the original content of Ballance. BML is divided into two versions, old (2015) and new (2020).

!!! warning "Choose the Correct Ballance Mod Loader"
    We **highly recommend** use BML 2020 version. Do NOT use 2015 version anymore. 2015 version is no longer supported.

<span style="opacity:0.3">Old version of BML can be downloaded on our [Mega network disk](#jump-9). The old version (2015 version) is named as `BallanceModLoader-Gamepiaynmo-Old(2015).msi`.</span>  
But for the **new version (2020 version)**, you should download it from [the release page of BallanceModLoader GitHub project](https://github.com/yyc12345/BallanceModLoader/releases/). In this release page, please download the latest build. Do **not** download the dev package (filename ending with `-dev`). Download **another** zip file is OK.

For different versions, different methods of installation should be used.

### New Version

!!! info "Migrate Infomation"
    For users with the old BML version, for example, those who have the "Debug Mode" mod installed, please remove that BML version. If you are unsure about how to remove it, consider uninstalling and re-installing Ballance itself.

!!! warning "Version Warning"
    I am highly recommend keeping your BML at the latest version. Some BML mod required the latest version of BML and the the latest version fix more bugs and will improve your game experience.

First, extract and merge the downloaded files with the Ballance folder.

If you are using compatibility modes to run the game, it should be set to Windows XP or above (since BML removed the system check that Ballance performs when booting the game, compatibility issues should disappear while using BML).

A "Ballance Mod Loader" mark at the top of the screen indicates that BML is installed correctly.

### Old Version

<span style="opacity:0.3">
Once you have it downloaded, the BallanceModLoader installer is presented as an MSI file and can be double-clicked to install. Unfortunately, the installer is only available in Chinese. What the most important thing during installation is that selecting a correct Ballance root folder (Which contains database.tdb).
